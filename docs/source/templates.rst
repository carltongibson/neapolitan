==================
Template reference
==================

Neapolitan provides generic templates that can be used as a starting point for
your project.

The default templates use TailwindCSS classes, for styling. See the `guide here
for integrating TailwindCSS with Django
<https://noumenal.es/notes/tailwind/django-integration/>`_.

The templates ``{% extends "base.html" %}``, which must provide
``{% block content %}``. Neapolitan may provide a base template in the future,
see `issue #6 <https://github.com/carltongibson/neapolitan/issues/6>`_.

This is the full listing of the provided templates:

.. code-block:: shell

    templates
    â””â”€â”€ neapolitan
        â”œâ”€â”€ object_confirm_delete.html
        â”œâ”€â”€ object_detail.html
        â”œâ”€â”€ object_form.html
        â”œâ”€â”€ object_list.html
        â””â”€â”€ partial
            â”œâ”€â”€ detail.html
            â””â”€â”€ list.html

Templates

You can override these templates by creating your own, either individually or as
a whole.
