==================
Template reference
==================

Neapolitan provides generic templates that can be used as a starting point for
your project.

The default templates use TailwindCSS classes, for styling. See the `guide here
for integrating TailwindCSS with Django
<https://noumenal.es/notes/tailwind/django-integration/>`_.

The templates ``{% extends "base.html" %}``, which must provide
``{% block content %}``. Neapolitan may provide a base template in the future,
see `issue #6 <https://github.com/carltongibson/neapolitan/issues/6>`_.

This is the full listing of the provided templates:

.. code-block:: shell

    templates
    â””â”€â”€ neapolitan
        â”œâ”€â”€ object_confirm_delete.html
        â”œâ”€â”€ object_detail.html
        â”œâ”€â”€ object_form.html
        â”œâ”€â”€ object_list.html
        â””â”€â”€ partial
            â”œâ”€â”€ detail.html
            â””â”€â”€ list.html

Templates
=========

You can override these templates by creating your own, either individually or as
a whole.

If you want to override a single template for your model, you can run the ``mktemplate``
management command:

.. code-block:: shell

    python manage.py mktemplate myapp.MyModel --list

You pass your model in the ``app_name.ModelName`` format, and then an option for the
CRUD template you want to override. The specified template will be copied to your app's
``templates``, using your active neapolitan default templates, and having the correct
name applied.

For example, the above command will copy the active ``neapoltian/object_list.html`` template to your app's
``templates/myapp/mymodel_list.html``, where it will be picked up by a ``CRUDView`` for
``MyModel`` when serving the list view.

See ``python manage.py mktemplate --help`` for full details.


.. admonition:: Under construction ðŸš§

    The templates are still being developed. If a change in a release affects
    you, you can copy the templates from the previous version to continue, but
    please also an open an issue to discuss.
